🤖 Gesture-Controlled Virtual Mouse | AI-Powered Human Interaction for Smart Spaces🎯
✨ Embarking on my first journey into AI-powered interfaces, I’ve built a gesture-controlled virtual mouse that transforms simple hand movements into powerful desktop actions — no touch required!

Using just a webcam and the power of MediaPipe, this system tracks hand movements in real-time to control mouse actions with intuitive gestures:

- With just a webcam and Python, this system interprets hand gestures to:
🎯 Cursor Movement – Guided by the index fingertip
👆 Left Click – A simple pinch between thumb and index
👉 Right Click – Thumb meets middle finger
✊ Drag & Drop – Index and middle fingers held together
🔃 Scroll – Vertical motion of the index finger
💡 Visual Feedback – A glowing green circle appears on click for instant confirmation
